# agent-scripts

Guidlines for Codex workflows.


## Pointer-Style Usage

- Lives in: `~/Projects/meta/agent-scripts/AGENTS.md`.
- Every consuming repo’s `AGENTS.md` is reduced to the pointer line `READ ~/Projects/agent-scripts/AGENTS.md BEFORE ANYTHING (skip if missing)`. Place repo-specific rules after that line if they’re truly needed.
